# üí´ About Me:
A person who knows the limitations are just lies that are made up by weak brains. That's why I always keep trying to achieve my goals and reach my dreams. I also encourage my teammates to do better.<br><br>I have always been into technology since I was 3(really). Problem solving, math and tech have always been the keys of pleasure of my life.
